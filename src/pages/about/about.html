        <p>
            It was Queen Onelu of Ikenga who wanted to exterminate and wipe out Ezigbo and Ezihu people from the surface of the earth because she believed they occupied their land by conquest. Being a very beautiful queen and very bouyant then she enlisted the support of her heart throbe being Ezeumeanolu of Ngo village. Ezeumeanolu initially agreed to the war plan of Queen Onelu of Ikenga to exterminate Ezigbo and Ezihu people. Ezeumeanolu helped her to get Abam, Abiriba and Ohaofia war mercenaries to execute the war. While the war was raging Ezigbo and Ezihu people were being decimated in great numbers it dawned on Ezeumeanolu that if his brothers were conquered by her female friend that in no distant time she will turn against him and he will not have close allies to fight on his side and blood they say is thicker than water. So he called all the warriors of Igboukwu to a meeting. These warriors attended;
            <ul style="list-style-type: none;">
                1 Ezenwosu of Ezigbo who before now was alone waging the war.
                <br>2. Ezeanozie of Umudege.
                <br>3. Ezeumeliwu of Ezihu.
                <br>4. Ezenwabachili of Obuno.
                <br>5. Ezeumeanolu of Ngo.
                <br>6. Ogbuchi of Etiti.
            </ul>
            When all assembled they agreed to fight together as Umunne. This unity brought about heavy defeat of Ikenga people that many of them ran into various Igbo communities as refugees. Oka and Okpoko ran to Isuofia, Oka Uga and Oka Aguluezechukwu, Ikenga Ogidi, Umuchu etc. Ikenga hitherto was nine strong villages but they were reduced to 2 villages till date. They sued for  peace. Ndi Igboukwu gave them only one condition that they will bring the head of Queen Onelu of Ikenga to them. They agreed. They went home and beheaded Queen Onelu who was nursing her abysmal defeat and was in low spirit and shame. They brought her head and gave it to Ndi Igboukwu.  The warriors agreed to bury her head at Ikirikiri Nkwo Igbo market . This last war brought Ezenwosu of Ezigbo to fame and also brought all Ihite to Ezigbo and from thence Ezigbo became the host of Ihite meetings at the house of Ezenwosu of Ezigbo and later the meeting was shifted to Nwafo Udoakwari before the Biafran War. Ezigbo became Ihite Political Headquarters, Ezihu our Economic Headquarters while Umudege remained our ancestral land. Chief Okafouzu Ugochukwu
